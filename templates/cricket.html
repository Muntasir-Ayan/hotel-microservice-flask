<p> 
  Cricket is played by two teams of 11, with one 
  side taking a turn to bat a ball and score runs, 
  <br> 
  while the other team will bowl and field the 
  ball to restrict the opposition from scoring.  
  <br> 
  The main objective in cricket is to score as many  
  runs as possible against the opponent.
